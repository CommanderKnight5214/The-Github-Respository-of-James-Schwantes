# The Github Respository of James Schwantes
Welcome to The Github Respository of James Schwantes. This respository contains all of the large projects that I have worked on over the past four years, while attending Concordia University of Wisconsin. Each of these projects can be placed into four categories, and each category can be listed as follows:

* [Internship/Capstone Project](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/Internship-Senior-Capstone-Project/tree/main): This project was a large project that I got to do during the course of Internship at SKYGEN USA. In addition to this I also got to claim this project as my Senior Capstone Project while attending Concordia University of Wisconsin as well. 

* [Hackathon Projects](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/Hackthon-Project): These projects were completed during a Hackathon Event. A Hackthon by definition is: "an event in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming."

* [Class Projects](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/Class-Projects/tree/main): These projects were completed during some of the classes that I was taking while attending Concordia University of Wisconsin.

* [Side Projects](https://github.com/CommanderKnight5214/MyPastProgrammingProjects/tree/main/My%20Personal%20Projects): All of these projects were completed on the side when I had some spair time, or when I had an idea to create a useful program that would help me with some repetitive tasks that I was doing.

These are the four categories that summarize all the projects that I have done over the past four years, and it is my hope and vision to continue working on many side projects for many years to come.
